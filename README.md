## Description about the application
🌳 Vanraksha: The Guardians of the Green
Vanraksha — a word forged from “Van” (forest) and “Raksha” (protection) — is more than a name; it’s a mission, a movement, a mindset.
In a world that’s fast forgetting the roots it grew from, Vanraksha stands tall like the ancient trees it vows to protect. It’s the digital-age warrior of the wilderness — a fusion of tech + tradition, fighting for forests not with fire, but with code, community, and conscience.

Whether it’s about monitoring illegal deforestation, promoting reforestation, enabling sustainable practices, or just spreading green awareness, Vanraksha is the silent sentinel whispering:

“The trees can’t speak, but we can scream for them.”

### 📸 **Vanraksha** – *Snap Nature. Spot Danger.*

**Vanraksha** is an AI-powered web tool that lets users **upload an image** — of land, forest, coastlines, skies — and instantly get a prediction of **potential natural disasters** like:

🌪️ Cyclones
🔥 Forest Fires
🌊 Floods
🪨 Landslides
🌾 Droughts
🌋 Volcanic activity (if you’re living dangerously)

#### 🚀 How it works:

* You upload an image (satellite, drone, mobile, anything clear).
* The backend AI model analyzes terrain, weather patterns, vegetation health, and topography.
* It identifies **risk patterns** and suggests the most probable calamity.

#### 🧠 Use Cases:

* **Farmers** checking crop or soil risks.
* **Forest officials** spotting early signs of fire or degradation.
* **Students & researchers** visualizing climate effects.
* **Disaster teams** making quicker assessments.

#### 🔥 Tagline ideas:

* “Detect Disaster Before It Strikes.”
* “Nature’s Early Warning System.”
* “One Upload Away from Safer Days.”
